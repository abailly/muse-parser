#title Standalone publishing utility
#author abailly@oqub.com

**WARNING**: this utility is extremely simple and just parses a directory
structure to reporduce it while formatting muse files in the
process. It is not and will never be a replacement for the full
publishing capability of Emacs muse-mode (or doxia for that
matter). We strongly advise involved users to try (and adopt !) muse
in its natural setting. 

**This feature will be present in 1.0-rc2**
