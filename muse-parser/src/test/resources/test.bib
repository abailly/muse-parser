                  software units to the way software classes and
                  components are connected. Thus, we are finding that
                  we need less emphasis on unit testing and more on
                  integration testing. The compositional relationships
                  of inheritance and aggregation, especially when
                  combined with polymorphism, introduce new kinds of
                  integration faults, which can be covered using
                  testing criteria that take the effects of
                  inheritance and polymorphism into account. This
                  paper demonstrates, via a set of experiments, the
                  relative effectiveness of several coupling-based O0
                  testing criteria and branch coverage. O0 criteria
                  are all more effective at detecting faults due to
                  the use of inheritance and polymorphism than branch
                  coverage.",

  abstract =	 {This paper addresses the problem of selecting finite
                  test sets and automating this selection. Among these
                  methods, some are deterministic and some are
                  statistical. The kind of statistical testing we
                  consider has been inspired by the work of
                  Thevenod-Fosse and Waeselynck. There, the choice of
                  the distribution on the input domain is guided by
                  the structure of the program or the form of its
                  specification. In the present paper, we describe a
                  new generic method for performing statistical
                  testing according to any given graphical description
                  of the behavior of the system under test. This
                  method can be fully automated. Its main originality
                  is that it exploits recent results and tools in
                  combinatorics, precisely in the area of random
                  generation of combinatorial structures. Uniform
                  random generation routines are used for drawing
                  paths from the set of execution paths or traces of
                  the system under test. Then a constraint resolution
                  step is performed, aiming to design a set of test
                  data that activate the generated paths. This
                  approach applies to a number of classical coverage
                  criteria. Moreover, we show how linear programming
                  techniques may help to improve the quality of test,
                  i.e. the probabilities for the elements to be
                  covered by the test process. The paper presents the
                  method in its generality. Then, in the last section,
                  experimental results on applying it to structural
                  statistical software testing are reported. }

  comment =	 "Application of CTL to test. CTL formulas represent
                  test coverage criteria such as state coverage,
                  transition coverage, all-def, all-use or all
                  affect-pair coverage. EFSM are transformed into
                  Kripke structures and model-checked against negation
                  of CTL to produce counter examples, eg. test
                  cases. The problem of minimizing the test suite or
                  the test sequences total length for a set of
                  formulas is shown to be NP-hard and a greedy
                  algorithm is presented. The CTL used is restricted
                  to finite path case (eg. without G modality and A
                  quantification, all formulas in positive normal
                  form,...). The EFSM are restricted to deterministic
                  case and sequential operations. The approach is
                  interesting and is something I was trying to explore
                  : the idea of modelling test coverage criteria or
                  objectives as temporal logic formulas sounds good as
                  the technology and theory of model-cheking is quite
                  advanced. "

                  evolves with the refinement process of the OO
                  design. The model, that is the test dependency
                  graph, serves as a basis for ordering classes and
                  methods to be tested for regression and integration
                  purposes (minimization of test stubs. The mapping
                  from UML to the defined model is detailed as well as
                  the test methodology. While the complexity of
                  optimal stub minimization is exponential with the
                  size of the model, an algorithm which computes a
                  strategy for integration testing with a quadratic
                  complexity is detailed This algorithm provides an
                  efficient testing order for minimizing the number of
                  stubs. A comparison is given of various integration
                  strategies with the proposed optimized algorithm (a
                  real-world case study illustrates this
                  comparison). The results of the experiments seem to
                  give nearly optimal stubs with a low cost despite
                  the exponential complexity of getting optimal
                  stubs. }

                  getting larger to fulfill more complicated tasks,
                  however, they are also becoming less
                  reliable. Consequently, testing is an indispensable
                  part of system design and implementation; yet it has
                  proved to be a formidable task for complex
                  systems. This motivates the study of testing finite
                  state machines to ensure the correct functioning of
                  systems and to discover aspects of their behavior. A
                  finite state machine contains a finite number of
                  states and produces outputs on state transitions
                  after receiving inputs. Finite state machines are
                  widely used to model systems in diverse areas,
                  including sequential circuits, certain types of
                  programs, and, more recently, communication
                  protocols. In a testing problem we have a machine
                  about which we lack some information; we would like
                  to deduce this information by providing a sequence
                  of inputs to the machine and observing the outputs
                  produced."

  abstract =	 {In the area of testing communication systems, the
                  interfaces between systems to be tested and their
                  testers have great impact on test generation and
                  fault detectability. Several types of such
                  interfaces have been standardized by the
                  International Standardization Organization (ISO). A
                  general distributed test architecture, containing
                  distributed interfaces, has been presented in the
                  literature for testing distributed systems based on
                  the Open Distributing Processing (ODP) Basic
                  Reference Model (BRM), which is a generalized
                  version of ISO distributed test architecture. We
                  study in this paper the issue of test selection with
                  respect to such a test architecture. In particular,
                  we consider communication systems that can be
                  modeled by finite state machines with several
                  distributed interfaces, called ports. A test
                  generation method is developed for generating test
                  sequences for such finite state machines, which is
                  based on the idea of synchronizable test
                  sequences. We then apply this method to generate
                  test sequences for a so-called quorum
                  protocol. Starting from the initial effort by
                  Sarikaya, a certain amount of work has been done for
                  generating test sequences for finite state machines
                  with respect to the ISO distributed test
                  architecture, all based on the idea of modifying
                  existing test generation methods to generate
                  synchronizable test sequences. However, none studies
                  the fault coverage provided by their methods. We
                  investigate the issue of fault coverage and point
                  out a fact that the methods given in the literature
                  for the distributed test architecture cannot ensure
                  the same fault coverage as the corresponding
                  original testing methods. We also study the
                  limitation of fault detectability in the distributed
                  test architecture. }

  abstract =	 {Protocol testing for the purpose of certifying the
                  implementation's adherence to the protocol
                  specification can be done with a test architecture
                  consisting of remote tester and local responder
                  processes generating specific input stimuli, called
                  test sequences, and observing the output produced by
                  the implementation under test. It is possible to
                  adapt test sequence generation techniques for finite
                  state machines, such as transition tour,
                  characterization, and checking sequence methods, to
                  generate test sequences for protocols specified as
                  incomplete finite state machines. For certain test
                  sequences, the tester or responder processes are
                  forced to consider the timing of an interaction in
                  which they have not taken part; these test sequences
                  are called nonsynchronizable. The three test
                  sequence generation algorithms are modified to
                  obtain synchronizable test sequences. The checking
                  of a given protocol for intrinsic synchronization
                  problems is also discussed. Complexities of
                  synchronizable test sequence generation algorithms
                  are given and complete testing of a protocol is
                  shown to be infeasible. To extend the applicability
                  of the characterization and checking sequences,
                  different methods are proposed to enhance the
                  protocol specifications: special test input
                  interactions are defined and a methodology is
                  developed to complete the protocol specifications. }

  abstract =	 {Although software testing is a crucial activity in
                  the software development process, only recently have
                  more sound and consistent testing tools become
                  available for testing Java programs and their
                  components. These tools support mostly functional
                  and control-flow based structural criteria. In this
                  paper we explore control-flow and data-flow based
                  coverage criteria to support the testing of Java
                  programs and/or components. We also describe a
                  testing tool, named JaBUTi, which can be used by
                  both the component developer and the component user
                  to test Java-based components and/or systems. To
                  achieve this goal, the tool works at the bytecode
                  level such that no source code is required during
                  the testing activity. We illustrate these ideas and
                  concepts with an example extracted from the
                  literature. }
